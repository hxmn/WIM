
In 2015-November/December, for TIS Task 1426, the triggers (to update well inventory counts) were re-worked to use Oracle Advanced Queuing.
The triggers are now saved in the Vault directory for the SCHEMA in which the trigger resides.
For example, triggers for objects in the PPDM schema are now in the 'PPDM' Vault folder.  
 See folder 'GeoChem' for the GPDR trigger for well inventory.
 See folder SEIS37 \ triggers for the SEIS37 trigger for well inventory.

To view the original well inventory triggers (for PPDM, GPDR, and SEIS37 schemas), see Vault repository Exploration Technology - TIS \ Well_Inventory \ Triggers \ zz_OLD
These triggers update the well inventory counts for specific data types (dir srvy, pden, completions, well logs, etc).
